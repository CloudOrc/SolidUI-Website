# Frequently Asked Questions

## Question answering process
First of all, users should refer to the official account and SolidUI official website for relevant information. These two platforms may already contain the answers or related solutions that users need. This step can effectively save the user's time and reduce the work pressure of the development team.
Community official website: https://website.solidui.top

However, if this step does not meet the user's needs, we enter the second stage: let the user submit an issue. At this stage, users can clearly describe the problems or requirements they encounter, and submit them to the project's issue tracking system. This not only helps the development team better understand the problem, but also serves as a reference for other users who encounter the same problem.

## epilogue
Overall, this Q&A process is an approach aimed at increasing efficiency and transparency. Not only does it help users find answers, but it also helps project teams better manage and track issues. Users can solve problems by themselves through official accounts and official website information; and through issue submission, users and the development team can communicate better and jointly promote the progress of the project.
