## Background

With the rise of language models for generating images from text, SolidUI aims to help people quickly build visualization tools, including 2D, 3D, and 3D scenes, to quickly construct three-dimensional data demonstration scenarios. SolidUI is an innovative project that aims to combine natural language processing (NLP) with computer graphics to achieve the function of generating pictures from text. By building its own language model for text-to-graph, SolidUI uses the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback) process to realize the process from text description to graphic generation.

### Model selects data source

Select the data source (open the icon on the right side of the input box), the input box contains the generated data and prompt words, send to the server

> [{"name":"n1","val":"1000"},{"name":"n2","val":"2000"},{"name":"n3","val":"3000"},{"name":"n4","val":"10000"}] generates a bar chart
