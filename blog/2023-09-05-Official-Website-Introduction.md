## Background

With the rise of language models for generating images from text, SolidUI aims to help people quickly build visualization tools. The visualization content includes 2D, 3D, and 3D scenes, thus quickly constructing three-dimensional data demonstration scenes. SolidUI is an innovative project that aims to combine natural language processing (NLP) with computer graphics to achieve text-to-graphic functions. By building its own text-to-graphic language model, SolidUI uses the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback) process to implement the process from text description to graphic generation.

## How to Contribute

Based on the official website project address, you can submit Issues and PRs for joint construction, with PRs submitted to the dev branch.

### Example

For documentation contributions, both Chinese and English versions need to be submitted as the official website supports internationalization.

**Submit an Issue**

1. First, visit the main page of the SolidUI-Website project.
2. In the top menu bar of the project, click "Issues".
3. Click the "New issue" button in the upper right corner.
4. Enter the title and description of your Issue on the page that appears.
5. When you're done, click "Submit new issue".
   **Submit a Pull Request**

Before submitting a Pull Request, you need to first fork the project and make changes on your branch. Here are the steps:

1. On the main page of the SolidUI-Website project, click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.
2. In your forked version, select or create the branch you want to modify. In this case, you should select or create a "dev" branch.
3. Make the required changes on your branch.
4. When you have completed the changes and submitted them to your GitHub repository, return to the main page of the SolidUI-Website project.
5. Click "Pull requests", then click "New pull request".
6. Click "compare across forks" and choose your fork and your "dev" branch.
7. Confirm your changes, then click "Create pull request".
8. Provide a title and description for your PR on the opened page, then click "Create pull request".

## Conclusion

Please note that the SolidUI-Doc community documentation project is no longer maintained. Future documentation resources will be maintained on the official website project.

We've introduced the SolidUI official website and how to submit Issues and PRs on GitHub. SolidUI is an AI-generated visualization prototyping and editing platform that supports 2D, 3D models, and is combined with a Large Language Model (LLM) for quick editing.

Participating in SolidUI's development, you can contribute by submitting Issues and PRs. Issues are used to report bugs or propose new feature suggestions, while PRs are used to submit your own code changes. When submitting a PR, you should first create or select an appropriate development branch (such as the dev branch) in your forked repository, then make changes on that branch. After completing the changes, you can create a PR, requesting to merge your changes into the original project.

Whether you are a user of SolidUI or a developer hoping to contribute, we welcome you to submit Issues and PRs on GitHub to jointly promote the development of SolidUI.
