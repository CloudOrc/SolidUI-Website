## Background

With the rise of language models for generating images from text, SolidUI aims to help people quickly build visualization tools, including 2D, 3D, and 3D scenes, for rapid construction of three-dimensional data demonstration scenes. SolidUI is an innovative project that aims to combine natural language processing (NLP) with computer graphics to realize the function of generating graphics from text. By building its own language model for generating graphics from text, SolidUI uses the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback) process to realize the process from text description to graphics generation.
